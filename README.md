# Vueccordion

This is a simple app that can play all the standard triad and seventh chords for you in all the keys. Right now it's really simple, where you can play all the harmonies with the buttons and only adjust volume and arpeggio rate. It works sort of like an accordion, yet with many more harmonies available.

It is created using Vue.js to quickly and easily set up the whole user interface layer. Deeper within the logic layers I use more Java-like classes to handle actually playing the chords, also making use of TypeScript. It's all nicely rendered with Webpack, also making use of Sass.
